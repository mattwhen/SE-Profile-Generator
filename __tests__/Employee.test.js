/* The describe method is a jest method for containg one or more tests.
it takes two arguments: a string for describing the test 
suite, and a callback function for wrapping the actual test */ 
// Remember, testing is a matter of INPUTS, FUNCTIONS, and expected OUTPUTS. 

// Write the test block: 
describe('', () => { 
    it('*Here is the test requirement*', () => {
        //actual test goes here.
        
    });
});
