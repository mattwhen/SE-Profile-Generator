# <b>Team Profile generator</b>

## <b>Description</b>
This application allows a user to quickly generate a README.md file by answering just a few questions such as the description, instllation, testing, etc. It saves the user a lot of time from having to manually create a README file from start as the file is automatically generated for you along with the user input in a new README.md file. 

## <b>Installation</b>
* Node.js
* Inquirer package (8.2.4)
* VS Code (or similar IDE)

## <b>How to use</b>
Open the project in your IDE, and open terminal in the root folder (SE-Profile-Generator) inside your IDE, or you can open a seprate terminal application and cd into the root folder, but using the integrated terminal in the IDE is much more convenient.
